    A convenience class for managing dictionaries that represent Mason
    objects. It provides nice shorthands for inserting some of the more
    elements into the object but mostly is just a parent for the much more
    useful subclass defined next. This class is generic in the sense that it

        in fact an array). However we are being lazy and supporting just one
